# ButtonsInHTML
This project shows different buttons like Submit , Reset , Simple/Vanilla , Autofocus , Disabled , Button As A Link created in HTML..
Moreover , we have also created an Alert Button which includes little bit inline JavaScript code to give an alert message on being clicked.
I have also created a customised button which is done by inline CSS through " style " attribute.
That's all done in this project .
Hope you find it usefull and if you do then don't forget to give a star because it is free as well as it will motivate me.
Thanks all !
